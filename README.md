# Ripples

Thinking about something more abstract than the sailing game idea.

What about just a hex grid of circles?

Each one knows about it's closest neighbors.

Each one responds to shifts in it's neighbor's "height" (or pressure or size or weight or whatever, just some metric)

User clicks on one to set it to 100, and by a function it flattens, sending out ripples to it's neighbors, hopefully making some kind of circular pattern.

Lots of potential to play with shape design

* hex
* squares/triangles
* walls/barriers
* wall shapes/reflection of energy, focus and diffusion
* turbulence vs uniformity

Could take a lot of fluid dynamics/geometry concepts in math and make them visually intuitive.

## Visualization

Circles, hexagons, some shape
Color, lightness, size, transform
Any of the above could represent the "pressure" data, or the rate of change in that pressure.
